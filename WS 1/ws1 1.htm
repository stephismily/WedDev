                    Sir Timothy John Berners-Lee (born 8 June 1955),[1] also known as TimBL, is an English
                    computer scientist best known as the inventor of the World Wide Web, HTML, the URL
                    system, and HTTP. He is a professorial research fellow at the University of Oxford and a
                    professor emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).<br><br>
                    Berners-Lee proposed an information management system on 12 March
                    1989[5][6] and implemented the first successful communication between a Hypertext
                    Transfer Protocol (HTTP) client and server via the Internet in mid-November.[7][8][9][10][11]
                    He devised and implemented the first Web browser and Web server and helped foster the
                    Web's subsequent development. He is the founder and emeritus director of the World Wide
                    Web Consortium (W3C), which oversees the continued development of the Web. He
                    co-founded (with Rosemary Leith) the World Wide Web Foundation. In April 2009, he was
                    elected as Foreign Associate of the National Academy of Sciences.<br><br>
                    Berners-Lee was previously a senior researcher and holder of the 3Com founder's
                    chair at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL).[14] He is a
                    director of the Web Science Research Initiative (WSRI)[15] and a member of the advisory
                    board of the MIT Center for Collective Intelligence.[16][17] In 2011, he was named as a
                    member of the board of trustees of the Ford Foundation.[18] He is a founder and president
                    of the Open Data Institute and is currently an advisor at social network MeWe.[19] In 2004,
                    Berners-Lee was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II for his pioneering work.[20][21] He received
                    the 2016 Turing Award "for inventing the World Wide Web, the first web browser, and the
                    fundamental protocols and algorithms allowing the Web to scale".[22] He was named in Time
                    magazine's list of the 100 Most Important People of the 20th century and has received a
                    number of other accolades for his invention.

                    Berners-Lee was born in London on 8 June 1955,[24] the son of mathematicians and computer scientists
                    Mary Lee Berners-Lee (née Woods; 1924–2017) and Conway Berners-Lee (1921–2019).
                    His parents were both from Birmingham and worked on the Ferranti Mark 1, the first
                    commercially-built computer. He has three younger siblings; his brother, Mike, is a professor
                    of ecology and climate change management.<br><br>
                    Berners-Lee attended Sheen Mount Primary School, then attended Emanuel School
                    (a direct grant grammar school at the time) from 1969 to 1973.[1][20] A keen trainspotter as
                    a child, he learnt about electronics from tinkering with a model railway.
                    From 1973 to 1976, he studied at The Queen's College, Oxford, where he received a
                    first-class BA in physics.[1][24] While there, he made a computer out of an old television set
                    he had purchased from a repair shop.

                <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0; font-family: Arial; line-height: 2;">
                    After graduation, Berners-Lee worked as an engineer at the telecommunications company
                    Plessey in Poole, Dorset.[24] In 1978, he joined D. G. Nash in Ferndown, Dorset, where he
                    helped create typesetting software for printers.
                    Berners-Lee worked as an independent contractor at CERN from June to December
                    1980. While in Geneva, he proposed a project based on the concept of hypertext, to facilitate
                    sharing and updating information among researchers.[27] To demonstrate it, he built a
                    prototype system named ENQUIRE.
                    After leaving CERN in late 1980, he went to work at John Poole's Image Computer
                    Systems, Ltd, in Bournemouth, Dorset.[29] He ran the company's technical side for three
                    years.[30] The project he worked on was a "real-time remote procedure call" which gave him
                    experience in computer networking.[29] In 1984, he returned to CERN as a fellow.
